    As it turned out in the discussion, OP needs the interface address on a Mac and not on an iOS device as I thought initially. The code referenced in the question checks for the interface name "en0", which is the WiFi interface on the iPhone. On a Mac it makes more sense to check for any "up-and-running" interface instead. Therefore I have rewritten the answer. It is now a Swift translation of the code in Detect any connected network.
    
    getifaddrs() is defined in <ifaddrs.h>, which is not included by default. Therefore you have to create a bridging header and add
    
    #include <ifaddrs.h>
    The following function returns an array with the names of all local "up-and-running" network interfaces.
